# MLTemplate for cookiecutter

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------
~~~bash
~$ cookiecutter https://gitlab.com/mlresearch1/mltemplate
or 
~$ cookiecutter https://github.com/NikitaSUAI/MLTemplate

### New version of Cookiecutter Data Science
------------
Cookiecutter data science is moving to v2 soon, which will entail using
the command `ccds ...` rather than `cookiecutter ...`. The cookiecutter command
will continue to work, and this version of the template will still be available.
To use the legacy template, you will need to explicitly use `-c v1` to select it.
Please update any scripts/automation you have to append the `-c v1` option (as above),
which is available now.

### Installing development requirements
------------

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the tests
------------

    py.test tests
